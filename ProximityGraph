Proximity analysis on textual data, such as verbatims, involves examining how closely certain words or phrases appear in relation to one another. This can help identify patterns, such as common associations or the context in which specific terms are used.

Here's a general approach to performing proximity analysis on a CSV file with verbatim data:

1. Load the Data
First, load the CSV file into a data frame.
2. Text Preprocessing
Tokenization: Break down the text into individual words or phrases.
Stopwords Removal: Remove common words like "and," "the," etc., that may not add value to the analysis.
Stemming/Lemmatization: Reduce words to their base form (e.g., "running" -> "run").
3. Define Target Words/Phrases
Specify the words or phrases you want to analyze for proximity.
4. Calculate Proximity
Window-based Approach: You can define a "window" (e.g., 5 words before and after the target word) and count the frequency of other words appearing within this window.
Co-occurrence Matrix: Create a matrix where rows and columns represent words, and the value represents the number of times they appear together within a specified window.
5. Analyze Results
Frequency Analysis: Identify the most frequent co-occurring words.
Network Graphs: Visualize the relationships between words using network graphs.
Heatmaps: Use heatmaps to visualize the proximity of terms.
Would you like to proceed with the proximity analysis using Python? If so, please upload the CSV file, and I can help you with the code to perform this analysis.

Explanation:
Load the CSV File: The code loads the CSV file using pandas. Replace 'your_file.csv' with your actual file path.

Text Preprocessing:

Tokenization: Converts the text into lowercase and splits it into individual words.
Stopwords Removal: Filters out common English stopwords.
Target Words: Replace ['your', 'target', 'words'] with the specific words you want to analyze for proximity.

Co-occurrence Calculation: The code creates a sliding window around each target word to count the frequency of nearby words.

Output: The proximity analysis results are printed, showing the top 10 words that frequently appear near each target word.

Next Steps:
Customization: You can modify the window_size and target_words to better suit your needs.
Visualization: Consider visualizing the results using libraries like matplotlib or networkx for network graphs or heatmaps.
